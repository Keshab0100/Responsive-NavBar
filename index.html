        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash
            equivalents, including closed-end funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). People generally believe that
            stocks, bonds, and cash comprise the core of a portfolio. Though this is often the case, it does not need to
            be the rule. A portfolio may contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and private
            investments.

            You may choose to hold and manage your portfolio yourself, or you may allow a money manager, financial
            advisor, or another finance professional to manage your portfolio.
